* IOT

** How IOT Works?
1. Sensors
   + Collecting data
2. Connectivity
   + Sending data to the cloud
3. Data Processing
   + Making the Data Useful
4. User interface
   + Delivering the information to the user

** Definition of IOT
"IOT is an umbrella term that refers to the billions of physical devices connected
to the internet, all collecting and exchanging data with one another."

** Types of IOT
