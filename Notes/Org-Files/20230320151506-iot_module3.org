* Machine to Machine Communication (M2M)
- Any technology that allows networked devices to exchange information and performs actions without any human intervention
- It can be wired or wireless
- Ex - Industrial manufacturing, Healthcare

** What it provides
- Machines can exchange information and co ordinate to perform actions

*** M2M vs IoT Differences

| M2M                        | IoT                              |
|----------------------------+----------------------------------|
| Machines                   | Sensors                          |
| Hardware Based             | Software Based                   |
| Deployed in closed Systems | Deployed on a large open network |
| Non-IP Protocol            | IP based protocol                |
| One-Way Communication      | Two-Way Communication            |
| Structured data            | Structured and Unstructured data |

** Machine to Machine importance
- These tranmissions allow data from sensors, tools and other devices to be transmitted to another device
  or an edge compiting device in order to report status, log a transacation, or give or request instruction
  for the device itself
** Why is M2M used?
- *Reduces Human Intervention*
- It reduces time, bandwidth and latency when facikitating automnomous actions b/w machine assets
- M2M data is used in advanced IIoT systems utilizing AI to create connected smart factories and drive superior
  process improvement
